Gulliver's Games Case Project 

//WHAT YOU HAVE//


What you have is a UI/screen that players open and they can unlock new skins that they use in the game.
You'll find the sprites in the project as well.


//WHAT WE NEED//

When player clicks unlock button, mechanic (green frame) should work like a "Wheel of Fortune" that randomly moves on different skins.

When green frame stops on a specific skin, that will be unlocked and player will see what that is.

This should happen in 4-5 sec max.

//WHAT WE EXPECT//

To see the above mechanic works in a good looking way; both for users & dev team.

GOOD LUCK! :)
